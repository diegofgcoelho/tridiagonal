# tridiagonal
C/C++ implementation of fast estimation of largest eigenvalue based on the Power method.
This implementation was written by Diego Coelho, PhD student at University of Calgary.
The inprogress branch stores information and changes in the project related to the fast estimation of the largest eigenvalue of tridiagonal matrices before being committed to the master branch.
